## Common Memory Patterns

### Finding Text
```
Pattern: "Hello World"
Use: Finding string literals in memory
```

### Finding Integers
```
Pattern: Little-endian bytes
Value 1000 (0x3E8) = "E8 03 00 00"
Value 256 (0x100) = "00 01 00 00"
```

### Finding Code Patterns
```
x64 function prologue: "48 89 5C 24 ??"
x64 function epilogue: "48 8B 5C 24 ??"
Call instruction: "E8 ?? ?? ?? ??"
```

## Memory Protection Types

| Protection | Meaning | Can Read | Can Write | Can Execute |
|------------|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `PAGE_READONLY` | Read-only data | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `PAGE_READWRITE` | Data section | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ` | Code section | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` | Self-modifying code | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `PAGE_NOACCESS` | Protected memory | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Address Format Examples

### Valid Formats
- `0x140000000` - Standard hex format
- `0x7FF123456789` - 64-bit address
- `0x00400000` - 32-bit style address

### Invalid Formats
- `140000000` - Missing 0x prefix
- `0x140000000G` - Invalid hex character
- `random_text` - Not a hex number

## Error Messages & Solutions

| Error | Most Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| "Access Denied" | Not Administrator | Run PowerShell as Admin |
| "Process not found" | Wrong PID or process closed | Use `list_processes` again |
| "Cannot read memory" | Invalid address | Check with `get_memory_regions` |
| "Process not in whitelist" | Security restriction | Add to `whitelist.json` |
| "Pattern not found" | Wrong pattern or region | Try broader search area |

## Configuration Files

### `server/config/settings.json`
```json
{
  "security": {
    "read_only_mode": true,
    "require_whitelist": true,
    "max_memory_read": 1048576
  }
}
```

### `server/config/whitelist.json`  
```json
{
  "processes": [
    {"name": "notepad.exe", "allowed": true},
    {"name": "calc.exe", "allowed": true}
  ]
}
```

## Assembly Basics

### Common x64 Instructions
- `mov rax, rbx` - Move data between registers
- `add rax, 10` - Add 10 to rax register
- `cmp rax, rbx` - Compare two values
- `je label` - Jump if equal
- `call function` - Call a function
- `ret` - Return from function

### Register Names (x64)
- `rax, rbx, rcx, rdx` - General purpose (64-bit)
- `eax, ebx, ecx, edx` - General purpose (32-bit)
- `rsp` - Stack pointer
- `rip` - Instruction pointer

## Useful Patterns for Games

### Health/Mana Values
```
Pattern: Look for 4-byte integers
Range: 0-1000 typically
Search: Convert to hex, scan memory
```

### Player Coordinates
```
Pattern: Float values
Typical: X, Y, Z as sequential floats
Size: 12 bytes (3 × 4-byte floats)
```

### String Tables
```
Pattern: Null-terminated strings
Format: "Text\x00" in memory
Search: Direct ASCII text search
```

```

## Safety Checklist

### Before Starting
- [ ] Running as Administrator
- [ ] Process is in whitelist
- [ ] Using safe test programs
- [ ] Have backup of important work

### During Analysis  
- [ ] Start with small memory reads
- [ ] Test patterns on known data first
- [ ] Don't analyze critical system processes
- [ ] Save interesting findings to files

### After Analysis
- [ ] Detach from all processes
- [ ] Review logs for any issues
- [ ] Document findings
- [ ] Close unnecessary programs

## Performance Tips

### Faster Memory Scans
- Limit scan regions with start/end addresses
- Use specific patterns instead of wildcards
- Increase alignment for faster scanning
- Focus on readable memory regions only

### Efficient Analysis
- Read larger chunks instead of many small reads
- Cache memory region information
- Use appropriate data types for your needs
- Batch similar operations together
