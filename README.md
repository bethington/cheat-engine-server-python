## ⚙️ Configuration

### Basic Configuration
The server uses configuration files in the `server/config/` directory:

#### `settings.json` (Auto-created on first run)
```json
{
  "security": {
    "read_only_mode": true,
    "require_whitelist": true,
    "log_all_operations": true
  },
  "performance": {
    "max_memory_read": 1048576,
    "scan_timeout": 30,
    "max_results": 1000
  }
}
```

#### `whitelist.json` (Process Access Control)
```json
{
  "processes": [
    {
      "name": "notepad.exe",
      "allowed": true,
      "description": "Text editor for testing"
    },
    {
      "name": "calculator.exe", 
      "allowed": true,
      "description": "Calculator application"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Security Settings Explained

| Setting | Description | Default | Recommendation |
|---------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| `read_only_mode` | Prevents memory writing | `true` | Keep enabled |
| `require_whitelist` | Only allow whitelisted processes | `true` | Enable for safety |
| `log_all_operations` | Log every operation | `true` | Enable for auditing |
| `max_memory_read` | Maximum bytes per read | 1MB | Adjust as needed |

## 🛠️ Using the Tools

### 1. Process Management

#### List Available Processes
```python
# Find processes you can attach to
result = use_tool("list_processes")
```
**What you'll see:**
- Process name and ID
- Memory usage
- Whether it's accessible
- Security level required

#### Attach to a Process
```python
# Attach to a specific process
result = use_tool("attach_to_process", {
    "process_id": 1234
})
```
**Best practices:**
- Start with simple programs like Notepad
- Always detach when finished
- Check the whitelist if attachment fails

### 2. Memory Reading

#### Read Memory at Address
```python
# Read 64 bytes starting at address 0x140000000
result = use_tool("read_memory_region", {
    "address": "0x140000000",
    "size": 64,
    "data_type": "bytes"
})
```

#### Supported Data Types
- `bytes` - Raw byte data
- `string` - ASCII/UTF-8 text
- `int32` - 32-bit signed integer
- `uint32` - 32-bit unsigned integer
- `int64` - 64-bit signed integer
- `uint64` - 64-bit unsigned integer
- `float` - 32-bit floating point
- `double` - 64-bit floating point

### 3. Memory Scanning

#### Search for Patterns
```python
# Find all occurrences of a byte pattern
result = use_tool("scan_memory", {
    "pattern": "48 8B 05 ?? ?? ?? ??",  # ?? = wildcard
    "start_address": "0x140000000",
    "end_address": "0x141000000"
})
```

#### Pattern Format Examples
- `"41 42 43"` - Find bytes 0x41, 0x42, 0x43
- `"48 ?? 05 ?? ?? ?? ??"` - Wildcards for unknown bytes
- `"Hello World"` - Search for ASCII text
- `"00 00 00 01"` - Find integer value 1

### 4. Code Analysis

#### Disassemble Assembly Code
```python
# Disassemble 100 bytes of code
result = use_tool("disassemble_code", {
    "address": "0x140001000",
    "size": 100,
    "architecture": "x64"
})
```

#### Analyze Data Structures
```python
# Analyze memory for data structures
result = use_tool("analyze_structure", {
    "address": "0x200000000",
    "size": 256
})
```

### 5. Pointer Chains

#### Follow Multi-Level Pointers
```python
# Resolve [[base + 0x10] + 0x20] + 0x30
result = use_tool("resolve_pointer_chain", {
    "base_address": "0x140000000",
    "offsets": [16, 32, 48]  # 0x10, 0x20, 0x30 in decimal
})
```

## 🔒 Safety & Security

### Read-Only Protection
The server **cannot modify memory** - it can only read and analyze. This prevents:
- Accidental program crashes
- Security vulnerabilities
- System instability

### Process Whitelist
Only approved processes can be accessed:
```json
{
  "processes": [
    {"name": "notepad.exe", "allowed": true},
    {"name": "suspicious.exe", "allowed": false}
  ]
}
```

### Operation Logging
All operations are logged to `logs/operations.log`:
```
2025-07-30 10:30:15 - INFO - Process attached: notepad.exe (PID: 1234)
2025-07-30 10:30:20 - INFO - Memory read: 0x140000000, size: 64
2025-07-30 10:30:25 - INFO - Process detached: notepad.exe
```

### Permission Requirements
- **Windows**: Run as Administrator
- **Linux**: Run as root or with appropriate capabilities
- **macOS**: May require disabling SIP for some operations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Access Denied" Error
**Problem**: Cannot attach to process
**Solutions**:
1. Run as Administrator
2. Check if process is in whitelist
3. Verify process is not protected by anti-virus

#### "Module Not Found" Error
**Problem**: Python dependencies missing
**Solution**:
```powershell
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### "Process Not Found" Error
**Problem**: Process ID doesn't exist
**Solutions**:
1. Use `list_processes` to get current IDs
2. Check if process is still running
3. Try process name instead of ID

#### Memory Read Fails
**Problem**: Cannot read memory at address
**Solutions**:
1. Check if address is valid with `get_memory_regions`
2. Verify memory protection allows reading
3. Try smaller read size

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```powershell
python server/main.py --debug
```

### Getting Help
1. Check the FAQ section below
2. Review log files in `logs/` directory
3. Verify configuration in `server/config/`
4. Test with simple programs like Notepad first

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### Cheat Engine Table Import
Import existing .CT files:
```python
result = use_tool("import_cheat_table", {
    "file_path": "C:/path/to/table.CT"
})
```

### Lua Script Analysis
Analyze Cheat Engine Lua scripts:
```python
result = use_tool("execute_lua_script", {
    "script_content": "print('Hello from Lua')",
    "safe_mode": true
})
```

### Custom Memory Regions
Define specific regions for analysis:
```python
# Get full memory map
regions = use_tool("get_memory_regions")

# Analyze specific region
for region in regions:
    if region['protect'] == 'PAGE_EXECUTE_READ':
        # Analyze executable memory
        pass
```

### Automation Examples
```python
# Complete analysis workflow
def analyze_process(process_name):
    # 1. Find and attach to process
    processes = use_tool("list_processes")
    target_pid = find_process_by_name(processes, process_name)
    
    # 2. Attach to process
    use_tool("attach_to_process", {"process_id": target_pid})
    
    # 3. Get memory layout
    regions = use_tool("get_memory_regions")
    
    # 4. Scan for patterns
    for region in regions:
        if region['readable']:
            scan_results = use_tool("scan_memory", {
                "pattern": "48 8B 05",
                "start_address": region['base_address'],
                "end_address": region['base_address'] + region['size']
            })
    
    # 5. Clean up
    use_tool("detach_from_process")
```
