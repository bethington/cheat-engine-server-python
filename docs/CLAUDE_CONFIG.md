Based on your current setup, here's the exact configuration you need for Claude Desktop:

## Configuration File Location

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

## Your Exact Configuration

Copy this configuration into your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cheat-engine": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "c:\\Users\\benam\\source\\dxt\\cheat-engine-server-python\\server\\main.py",
        "--debug",
        "--read-only"
      ],
      "cwd": "c:\\Users\\benam\\source\\dxt\\cheat-engine-server-python"
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Setup Steps

1. **Close Claude Desktop** completely
2. **Open File Explorer** and navigate to: `%APPDATA%\Claude\`
3. **Create or edit** `claude_desktop_config.json`
4. **Paste the configuration above** (replacing any existing content)
5. **Save the file**
6. **Restart Claude Desktop**

## Test It

In a new Claude conversation, ask:
```
Please use the MCP Cheat Engine server to list the currently running processes.
```

If working correctly, Claude will respond with a list of processes from your system.

## Troubleshooting

If it doesn't work:

1. **Check the file path** - Make sure `c:\Users\benam\source\dxt\cheat-engine-server-python\server\main.py` exists
2. **Run Claude as Administrator** - Required for memory access
3. **Check Python installation** - Make sure `python` command works in Command Prompt
