# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the MCP Cheat Engine Server?

**Q: What exactly does this tool do?**

A: The MCP Cheat Engine Server is a safe, educational tool that lets you examine computer memory through AI assistants. It provides similar functionality to Cheat Engine but operates in read-only mode and integrates with AI systems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Q: Is this tool safe to use?**

A: Yes! The server operates in read-only mode, meaning it can only read and analyze memory - it cannot modify anything. This prevents crashes, system instability, or security issues. All operations are logged for security auditing.

**Q: Do I need Cheat Engine installed to use this?**

A: No! This is a standalone tool that provides memory analysis functionality without requiring Cheat Engine. However, it can import and analyze Cheat Engine table files (.CT files).

**Q: What operating systems are supported?**

A: Primary support is for Windows 10/11. Limited functionality is available on Linux and macOS, but some Windows-specific features won't work on other platforms.

## Installation and Setup

### System Requirements

**Q: What are the minimum system requirements?**

A: You need:
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit recommended)
- Python 3.9 or higher  
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- Administrator privileges
- 4GB free disk space

**Q: Why do I need Administrator privileges?**

A: Windows requires elevated privileges to read memory from other processes for security reasons. This is a Windows security feature, not a limitation of our tool.

**Q: Can I run this without Administrator rights?**

A: No, memory access operations require Administrator privileges on Windows. This is a fundamental Windows security requirement that cannot be bypassed.

### Installation Issues

**Q: "Python is not recognized" - what does this mean?**

A: This means Python isn't properly installed or isn't in your system PATH. Solutions:
1. Reinstall Python and check "Add to PATH" during installation
2. Restart your computer after installing Python
3. Verify installation by typing `python --version` in Command Prompt

**Q: "pip is not recognized" - how do I fix this?**

A: This usually means Python wasn't installed correctly:
1. Uninstall Python from Control Panel
2. Download fresh Python installer from python.org
3. During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
4. Restart your computer
5. Test with `pip --version`

**Q: The installation seems to hang or take forever**

A: This is usually normal! The first installation downloads many files:
- Be patient - it can take 5-10 minutes on slow connections
- Don't close the window even if it looks stuck
- If it truly hangs for 30+ minutes, restart and try again

**Q: My antivirus is blocking the installation**

A: Some antivirus programs are overly cautious:
1. Temporarily disable real-time protection during installation
2. Add the server folder to your antivirus exclusions
3. Re-enable protection after installation
4. This is a false positive - the tool is safe

## Usage and Features

### Basic Operations

**Q: What processes should I start with as a beginner?**

A: Start with simple, safe programs:
- Notepad (notepad.exe) - Perfect for learning
- Calculator (calc.exe) - Simple and safe
- Your own test programs
- Avoid games or system processes initially

**Q: How do I know if a process is safe to analyze?**

A: Safe processes are typically:
- Simple applications like text editors
- Your own programs
- Open-source software
- Programs you have permission to analyze

Avoid:
- System critical processes
- Antivirus software
- Online games (may violate terms of service)
- Commercial software without permission

**Q: What's the difference between attaching and detaching?**

A: 
- **Attaching** opens a connection to a process so you can read its memory
- **Detaching** safely closes that connection
- Always detach when finished to free up system resources
- You can only be attached to one process at a time

### Memory Analysis

**Q: What are memory addresses and how do I use them?**

A: Memory addresses are locations in computer memory, like house addresses:
- Format: `0x140000000` (hexadecimal, starting with 0x)
- Each address points to one byte of data
- Valid addresses depend on the specific program
- Use "Get memory regions" to find valid address ranges

**Q: What data types should I use for reading memory?**

A: Choose based on what you're looking for:
- **bytes** - Unknown data, raw analysis
- **string** - Text data  
- **int32/uint32** - Most common for numbers, pointers
- **int64/uint64** - Large numbers, 64-bit pointers
- **float/double** - Decimal numbers

**Q: Why am I getting "Cannot read memory at address" errors?**

A: Common causes:
- Invalid address (doesn't exist in the process)
- Memory is protected (not readable)
- Process has been terminated
- Address is outside valid memory regions

Solution: Use "Get memory regions" first to find readable areas.

**Q: How do pattern searches work?**

A: Pattern searching finds specific byte sequences:
- `41 42 43` - Find exact bytes 0x41, 0x42, 0x43
- `48 ?? 05` - Find 0x48, any byte, 0x05 (wildcard)
- `"Hello"` - Find ASCII text
- `?? ?? ?? ??` - Four unknown bytes

### Advanced Features

**Q: What are pointer chains and how do I use them?**

A: Pointer chains are multiple levels of memory references:
- Base address points to another address
- That address points to another address  
- Continue following until you reach the final value
- Common in games and complex programs
- Example: `[[base + 0x10] + 0x20] + 0x30`

**Q: Can I analyze assembly code?**

A: Yes! The disassembly feature converts machine code to readable assembly:
- Useful for understanding program logic
- Requires some assembly language knowledge
- Best used on executable memory regions
- Shows instruction addresses, opcodes, and mnemonics

**Q: What are Cheat Engine tables and can I use them?**

A: Cheat Engine tables (.CT files) contain memory addresses and scripts:
- You can import and analyze existing .CT files
- The tool extracts addresses and data types
- Lua scripts are analyzed for safety but not executed
- Great for learning from existing research

## Security and Safety

### Read-Only Mode

**Q: What exactly does "read-only mode" mean?**

A: Read-only mode means the tool can:
✅ Read memory contents
✅ Analyze data structures  
✅ Search for patterns
✅ Disassemble code

But it CANNOT:
❌ Modify memory values
❌ Change program behavior
❌ Write to memory
❌ Inject code

**Q: Can this tool crash programs or my computer?**

A: It's extremely unlikely because:
- Read-only operations are generally safe
- No memory modification occurs
- Process attachment is non-invasive
- The tool includes safety checks and timeouts

However, very rarely, even reading certain memory regions might cause instability in poorly written programs.

**Q: Is it legal to use this tool?**

A: Generally yes, for legitimate purposes:
✅ Analyzing your own programs
✅ Educational research  
✅ Security research on permitted software
✅ Debugging and development

⚠️ Be careful with:
- Commercial software (check license terms)
- Online games (may violate terms of service)
- Software you don't own
- Reverse engineering proprietary code without permission

### Process Whitelist

**Q: What is the process whitelist and why do I need it?**

A: The whitelist controls which programs can be analyzed:
- Prevents accidental analysis of system processes
- Reduces security risks
- Forces intentional, deliberate choices
- Can be customized for your needs

**Q: How do I add programs to the whitelist?**

A: Edit `server/config/whitelist.json`:
```json
{
  "processes": [
    {
      "name": "myprogram.exe",
      "allowed": true,
      "description": "My test program"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Q: Can I disable the whitelist?**

A: Not recommended, but you can set `require_whitelist: false` in `server/config/settings.json`. This is less secure and not recommended for beginners.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

**Q: "Access Denied" when attaching to process**

A: This usually means:
1. Not running as Administrator (most common)
2. Process is protected by antivirus
3. Process has higher privileges than your session
4. Process is a system-critical component

**Q: "Process not found" error**

A: Check that:
1. Process is still running (didn't crash/close)
2. You're using the correct Process ID (PID)
3. Process name is spelled correctly
4. Process hasn't changed PID since listing

**Q: Memory reads return empty or invalid data**

A: Possible causes:
1. Memory region is not committed/allocated
2. Data has moved due to program execution
3. Address calculation is incorrect
4. Process memory layout has changed

**Q: Scans find no results even though data should exist**

A: Try:
1. Scanning a smaller memory region
2. Using wildcards in your pattern
3. Checking if the target data format is different
4. Verifying the process has the expected data

### Performance Issues

**Q: Memory scans are very slow**

A: Speed up scans by:
1. Limiting scan regions with start/end addresses
2. Using more specific patterns (fewer wildcards)
3. Increasing alignment values
4. Scanning only readable memory regions

**Q: The tool uses a lot of memory**

A: This is normal for memory analysis tools:
- Close other applications if needed
- Use smaller read sizes
- Limit scan results
- Detach from processes when not needed

**Q: Operations timeout frequently**

A: Increase timeout values in `server/config/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "performance": {
    "scan_timeout": 60,
    "read_timeout": 10
  }
}
```
