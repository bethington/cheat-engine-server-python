# DBEngine Cheat Table MCP Client

## Overview

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) client demonstrates the complete workflow of the Cheat Engine Server by:

1. **Launching DBEngine Application** - Tests the application launcher functionality
2. **Loading Cheat Tables** - Parses and analyzes `.CT` (Cheat Table) files  
3. **Memory Address Analysis** - Extracts and displays memory addresses from cheat tables
4. **Advanced Memory Scanning** - Demonstrates 21 advanced Cheat Engine features
5. **Clean Termination** - Properly closes processes and handles

## Features Demonstrated

### 🚀 **Application Launcher**
- Whitelist validation for DBEngine 
- Elevated process launching with UAC handling
- Process monitoring and status tracking
- Safe termination with cleanup

### 📋 **Cheat Table Parser**
- Support for both XML and binary `.CT` formats
- Entry categorization (groups, addresses, pointers)
- Type detection (bytes, integers, floats, strings)
- Hotkey and script analysis

### 🔍 **Advanced Memory Analysis** (21 Methods)
1. **Memory Scanning**: Value/range/wildcard pattern searches
2. **Code Disassembly**: x64 disassembly with Capstone integration  
3. **Pointer Chains**: Multi-level pointer resolution
4. **Memory Snapshots**: Change detection and comparison
5. **String References**: Find code that references strings
6. **Data Structure Analysis**: Automatic vtable/array detection
7. **Progressive Scanning**: "Next scan" functionality
8. **Memory Utilities**: Protection flags and type conversions

### 🛡️ **Privilege Handling**
- Graceful degradation when insufficient privileges
- Demonstration mode for restricted environments
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Usage
