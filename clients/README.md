## 🛠️ Usage

### Running Clients

All clients should be run from the project root directory:

```bash
# From project root
python clients/simple_client.py
python clients/enhanced_client.py
python clients/reliable_client.py
python clients/working_client.py
python clients/complete_client.py
```

### Common Workflow

All clients follow a similar automation workflow:

1. **Initialize**: Set up MCP components and GUI automation
2. **Launch**: Open target application (Notepad)
3. **Automate**: Send keystrokes and text input
4. **Scan**: Search for text patterns in memory
5. **Report**: Display results and memory addresses
6. **Cleanup**: Close application and clean up resources

## 🔧 Configuration

### Server Integration

All clients automatically configure themselves to work with the MCP server:

```python
# Automatic server path configuration
project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))
server_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'server')
sys.path.insert(0, server_path)

# Import server components
from server.gui_automation.core.integration import PyAutoGUIController
```

### Import Structure

The clients use the organized server module structure:

```python
# GUI Automation
from server.gui_automation.core.integration import PyAutoGUIController
from server.gui_automation.tools.mcp_tools import ALL_PYAUTOGUI_TOOLS

# Memory and Process Management
from memory.scanner import MemoryScanner
from process.manager import ProcessManager
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test

Test any client with:

```bash
python clients/reliable_client.py
```

Expected output:
```
🎯 Starting Reliable MCP Automation Workflow

   server_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'server')
   sys.path.insert(0, server_path)
   ```
3. Import from server modules
4. Implement the standard workflow
5. Add comprehensive error handling

### Extending Existing Clients
